It allows users to add tasks with detailed descriptions and due dates, view a list of all tasks, and delete tasks once completed. The application features a clean and responsive design, ensuring accessibility across various devices.

The "Add Task" page includes a straightforward form for creating new tasks, with input fields for the task name, description, and due date. A navigation button allows users to easily return to the homepage. The interface is styled with custom CSS for a modern and visually appealing look, with attention to layout and usability.
