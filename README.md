Project Description: Task Manager

The Task Manager is a simple and user-friendly web application designed to help users organize and manage their tasks effectively. It allows users to add tasks with detailed descriptions and due dates, view a list of all tasks, and delete tasks once completed. The application features a clean and responsive design, ensuring accessibility across various devices.

The "Add Task" page includes a straightforward form for creating new tasks, with input fields for the task name, description, and due date. A navigation button allows users to easily return to the homepage. The interface is styled with custom CSS for a modern and visually appealing look, with attention to layout and usability.

This project is ideal for beginners looking to learn about web development concepts, including HTML for structure, CSS for styling, and server-side logic for dynamic content rendering and task management.
